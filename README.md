# calvino-unsaid
Italo Calvino and the unsaid: a formal approach.

This programme performs an analysis of the semantic sphere of the unsaid in Calvino's work "*Lezioni americane. Sei proposte per il prossimo millennio*". The analysis is conducted at the level of the named entities, the lexis and the dependencies present in the text. The results are displayed in two modalities: an overall knowledge graph in RDF Turtle syntax and a graphical display in HTML.
