# calvino-unsaid
Italo Calvino and the unsaid: a formal approach.

This programme performs an analysis of the semantic sphere of the unsaid in Calvino's work "*Lezioni americane. Sei proposte per il prossimo millennio*". The analysis is conducted at the level of the named entities, the lexis and the syntactic dependencies present in the text. The results are displayed in two modalities: an overall knowledge graph in RDF Turtle syntax (*see* graphs folder) and a graphical display in HTML. For the latter, explore the website [A close reading of Italo Calvinoâ€™s *Lezioni Americane*: Leggerezza.](https://eleonoraperuch.github.io/lezioni-americane/index.html) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EleonoraPeruch/lezioni-americane) with the code behind it.
